# School_District_Analysis
School District Analysis Repository Model 4

Deliverable 3 Instructions
For this part of the Challenge, write a report that summarizes your updated analysis and compares it with the results from the module.

The analysis should contain the following:

## Overview of the school district analysis:

The school board had notified Maria (the client) and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv data file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has requesgted to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once we have replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like to repeat the school district analysis that we did and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis. 

Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

How is the district summary affected?
